## KYC Factory Contract

The KYC Factory Contract is a higher-level Solana smart contract designed to manage multiple instances of KYC batches. Instead of dealing with individual KYC records or even individual KYC batches, the KYC Factory Contract serves as a controller that can spawn, manage, and reference multiple KYC Batch Contracts.

### Purpose:

The KYC process is ongoing, with new batches of KYC data being generated regularly. Instead of updating a single contract continuously, the Factory pattern allows for the creation of new batch contracts, thus keeping the system modular, efficient, and scalable.

### Functions and Features:

1. CreateBatch:
    - Purpose: Initiates a new KYC Batch Contract.
    - Details: Whenever there's a need for a new batch of KYC data to be stored, this function can be called. It will deploy a new KYC Batch Contract and store its reference within the factory.

2. GetBatchReference:
    - Purpose: Retrieve a reference (like an address or ID) to a specific KYC Batch Contract.
    - Details: External entities or systems might want to verify or interact with a specific KYC batch. Using this function, they can get the required reference to that batch contract.

3. ListAllBatches:
    - Purpose: Lists all the KYC Batch Contracts that have been initiated by the factory.
    - Details: Useful for administrative or audit purposes. It can give a holistic view of all batches ever created, their statuses, and other meta-information.

4. ExpireBatch:
    - Purpose: Marks a specific KYC Batch Contract as expired.
    - Details: Over time, certain batches may no longer be relevant, or their validity period lapses. This function allows the factory to mark them as expired, ensuring they aren't used for future verifications.

5. AdminFunctions (Placeholder):
    - Purpose: General administrative functions for overseeing and managing the entire ecosystem of KYC Batch Contracts.
    - Details: This is a placeholder for any administrative controls that might be needed as the system grows and evolves.

### Contract's Utility:

The KYC Factory Contract is crucial in scenarios where KYC data needs to be managed in a scalable, modular fashion. With the advent of more data and changing requirements, updating or managing a single monolithic contract can become challenging. The Factory pattern simplifies this by compartmentalizing data into batches, each managed by its own contract. The Factory serves as a controller, offering a single point of interaction for external systems, while internally handling the complexities of batch management.

By using a KYC Factory Contract, you can streamline the process of managing multiple KYC data batches, ensuring each batch's integrity and offering a systematic approach to data verification and management on the Solana blockchain.
