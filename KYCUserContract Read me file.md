## KYC User Contract

### Introduction:
The KYC User Contract is a Solana smart contract specifically designed to manage the KYC data pertaining to an individual user. The contract does not store the raw KYC data but instead maintains a cryptographic hash representing that data. This ensures that personal data remains off-chain, preserving user privacy while maintaining the ability to verify the integrity of the data on-chain.

### **Functions and Features:**

1. SetUserData:
    - Purpose: This function allows the system to store or update the hash of a user's KYC data on the blockchain.
    - Details: Instead of storing the actual raw KYC data, the application will preprocess this data off-chain, hash it, and then use `SetUserData` to store this hash on-chain.

2. GetUserData:
    - Purpose: Facilitates the retrieval of a user's stored KYC hash. 
    - Details: This is especially useful for external entities or the user themselves to confirm that their KYC data is on the blockchain.

3. VerifyUserData:
    - Purpose: Allows the system to confirm the authenticity of a user's off-chain KYC data by comparing its hash with the on-chain stored hash.
    - Details: An external system or party can hash a user's KYC data (off-chain) and provide this hash to the `VerifyUserData` function. The function will then compare this hash against the stored on-chain hash. If they match, it means the provided data is authentic and hasn't been tampered with.

4. RevokeAccess:
    - Purpose: Provides the user with the ability to invalidate their stored KYC hash. 
    - Details: There might be instances when a user wishes to indicate that their existing KYC data should no longer be valid (e.g., they've updated their data, or they suspect a security breach). By using `RevokeAccess`, the stored hash becomes invalidated, and verification processes would know not to trust data matching that hash.

5. Timestamps and Expiry:
    - Purpose: Each KYC data hash is associated with creation and expiration timestamps.
    - Details: This mechanism ensures that KYC data remains up-to-date. After a specific time (e.g., one year), the stored hash might be considered outdated and would need renewal.

### Contract's Utility:
In modern digital platforms, especially in financial sectors, Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures are paramount. They ensure that the platform knows the true identity of their users, preventing fraud and malicious activities. By having a KYC User Contract on a blockchain like Solana, platforms can benefit from:

- Immutability: Once KYC data (in hashed form) is stored on the blockchain, it cannot be tampered with.
- Transparency: Users and services can verify KYC data at any time.
- Privacy: By storing only a hash and not the actual personal data, the system respects user privacy while still maintaining a robust verification mechanism.

In essence, the KYC User Contract acts as a bridge between off-chain KYC data and on-chain verification systems, allowing platforms to leverage the strengths of blockchain technology in their KYC processes.
